                <p>It would seem that the biggest craze in this society over the past 25 years is the modern paradigm of "mental illness". Indeed, it appears that the chicest buzzword over the past few decades has been "mental health". The idea permeates throughout all spheres of society, however, what the phrase truly denotes is a highly ineffective, or rather outright fraudulent, mental illness industry and its accompanying culture. When a society relegates the treatment of diseases of consciousness to a class of callous, profit-driven neural-mutilators who are trained to view the human brain as a piece of meat, it is no surprise that such a racket has emerged.</p>
                <p>
                    The traumatic accounts of the survivors of the mentally disfiguring practices of this industry bear testimony to its inherent cruelty and fraudulent nature. These lived experiences are further validated by an empirical overview. The stated goal of this multi-billion dollar<span class="popupcontainer"><sup><a id="1" class="insetcitations" href="#1cit">1</a></sup><span class="citationtooltip"><a class = "citationnumbers" href="#1">[1]</a> <a class = "citationlinks" target = "_blank" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/06/22/2467263/0/en/Global-Mental-Health-Market-is-estimated-to-be-US-527-44-billion-by-2030-with-a-CAGR-of-3-40-during-the-forecast-period-By-PMI.html">"Global Mental Health Market is estimated to be US$ 527.44 billion by 2030", Globe Newswire</a></span></span> 
                    pharma-centric industry has been to increase the psychological welfare of the populace, however, key metrics of societal psychological health, such as the continually increasing suicide rate<span class="popupcontainer"><sup><a id="2" class="insetcitations" href="#2cit">2</a></sup><span class="citationtooltip"><a class = "citationnumbers" href="#2">[2]</a><a class = "citationlinks" target = "_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/187478/death-rate-from-suicide-in-the-us-by-gender-since-1950/">"Deaths by suicide per 100,000 resident population in the United States from 1950 to 2019", by gender, Statistica</a></span></span>

                    signal a gross failure in achieving this aim. While an industry purporting to diminish mental illness has experienced exponential growth<span class="popupcontainer"><sup><a id="4" class="insetcitations" href="#4cit">4</a></sup><span class="citationtooltip"><a class = "citationnumbers" href="#4">[4]</a><a class = "citationlinks" target = "_blank" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/trends-in-prescriptions-and-costs-of-drugs-for-mental-disorders-in-england-19982010/2F552E3BFF33EC63C302D86CFE1A1097">"Prescriptions of drugs used for mental disorders increased by 6.8% ... per year on average", The British Journal of Psychiatry</a></span></span>  
                    in the 21st century, the aforementioned indicators point to a precipitous drop in general mental well-being during the same time period.
                </p>
                <p>This absurd state of affairs is a natural consequence of the misconceived attempts of a spiritually vacant society to address the complications of something as deeply spiritually rooted as human consciousness itself. When complications of consciousness are viewed through the prism of modernity, a profoundly malformed conception of "mental health" arises. Societal success is not measured by the spiritual and psychological well-being of its members, but rather by their productive capacity. As such, afflictions of consciousness are not problematic because they are a source of suffering but because they impede production. The structures that formed to address "mental illness" were not formed on the compassionate basis of alleviating suffering but rather to combat a threat to economic maximization. This distinction in motivation is not subtle but rather of substantial consequence. </p>
                <p>Because of this warped motive, a broad and disparate set of behaviours, emotional dynamics, and non-normative states of consciousness that were all determined to be obstructive to an individual's immediate productive readiness were lumped in together under this rubric of "mental illness". From states of being as basic to the human experience as "generalized anxiety" all the way to severely non-normative states of consciousness where a grotesque psychical invasion of the mind is perceived. With causations as trivial as someone having a bad day all the way to complications rooted in the creative spring of consciousness itself. All of these conditions were consigned to the management of a parasitic group comprised of state-sponsored drug-barons, twisted idealogues, and an army of modern day quacks on the front lines.</p>
                <p>Seated at the height of arrogance, they hold themselves up as supreme authorities on the welfare of the human spirit, illuminated by the profound wisdom and humanity found in the hard sciences. Examples of some of their deeply enlightened standard practices include forcibly administering drugs that have life-destroying collateral effects<span class="popupcontainer"><sup><a id="5" class="insetcitations" href="#5cit">5</a></sup><span class="citationtooltip"><a class = "citationnumbers" href="#5">[5]</a><a class = "citationlinks" target = "_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36225523/">"Antipsychotic medications have been well-established to potentially cause ... hyperkinesia, tremor, dyskinesia, dystonia, and parkinsonism", National Library of Medicine</a></span></span> <span class="popupcontainer"><sup><a id="6" class="insetcitations" href="#6cit">6</a></sup><span class="citationtooltip"><a class = "citationnumbers" href="#6">[6]</a><a class = "citationlinks" target = "_blank" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/something-so-sacred-has-been-taken-away-from-me/article_db093029-b233-5d2c-b306-452d323b7467.html">"Something So Sacred Has Been Taken Away from Me", Toronto Star</a></span></span> 
                    and stockading law-abiding citizens who could be helped by elementary human compassion in long-term detention facilities where they are mentally and physically tormented<span class="popupcontainer"><sup><a id="7" class="insetcitations" href="#7cit">7</a></sup><span class="citationtooltip"><a class = "citationnumbers" href="#6">[7]</a><a class = "citationlinks" target = "_blank" href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7132762/psychiatrists-ontario-liable-patient-abuse/">"Psychiatrists, Ontario government liable for horrific patient abuse at mental health facility", The Canadian Press</a></span></span> <span class="popupcontainer"><sup><a id="8" class="insetcitations" href="#8cit">8</a></sup><span class="citationtooltip"><a class = "citationnumbers" href="#6">[8]</a><a class = "citationlinks" target = "_blank" href="https://www.madinamerica.com/2018/12/mia-survey-force-trauma-sexual-abuse-mental-hospitals/">"MIA Survey: Ex-patients Tell of Force, Trauma and Sexual Abuse in America’s Mental Hospitals", MIA</a></span></span>. 
                    Such brutish acts are informed by a twisted vision that holds human consciousness to be a purposeless secretion of the brain; itself, a mere piece of flesh that can be chemically lacerated to bend consciousness to the will of economic urgency. Rather than the recognition of consciousness being divinely governed, it is viewed instead as an ill-fated byproduct of the mechanistic processes of the brain and under the sole authority of its physical configuration.</p>
                <p>This contorted worldview can not fathom a spiritual basis for non-normative states of consciousness. Such states are seen merely as the deviant expressions of physical aberrations in the brain. Thus, when a person perceives a horrifying psychical invasion of their mind, the spiritual dimensions of their experience are contemptuously dismissed as the warped projections of a glitching physical system. While it is considered the height of spirituality to capriciously experiment with dangerous "psychedelic" drugs, the same states of consciousness that these drugs were originally thought to be a mechanism for studying<span class="popupcontainer"><sup><a id="9" class="insetcitations" href="#9cit">9</a></sup><span class="citationtooltip"><a class = "citationnumbers" href="#9">[9]</a><a class = "citationlinks" target = "_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9154737/">"LSD ... was originally perceived as a psychotomimetic capable of producing a model psychosis", National Library of Medicine</a></span></span> 
                    are dismissed as the distortive output of a malfunctioning brain. When someone relates their drug-induced experiences of consciously interfacing with interdimensional beings they are readily believed with broad and fervent enthusiasm<span class="popupcontainer"><sup><a id="10" class="insetcitations" href="#10cit">10</a></sup><span class="citationtooltip"><a class = "citationnumbers" href="#10">[10]</a><a class = "citationlinks" target = "_blank" href="https://gala.gre.ac.uk/id/eprint/34311/">"DMT entity encounters: dialogues on the spirit molecule", University of Greenwich</a></span></span> 
                    but when a person perceives an egregious violation of their soul through an intrusion of their consciousness they are not only dismissed as being unattuned to their own lived experience but further subjected to psychiatric "treatment" consisting of confinement, verbal abuse, and gross physical violations.</p>
                <p>Those who are facing these kinds of spiritual and systemic assaults on their minds can be assured that even if the mind becomes compromised, the heart can be relied on for sustenance and survival. The dominant mechanistic worldview rejects a truth so fundamental that it has been intuitively known by humanity throughout the ages: that the heart is central to human consciousness. Were the heart merely a mindless organ with the sole purpose of performing a simple mechanical function, its deeper activity would not have become intuitively embedded in human languages across time and culture. Even the scientists are forced to acknowledge evidence of personality changes in heart transplant patients that match the donor.<span class="popupcontainer"><sup><a id="11" class="insetcitations" href="#11cit">11</a></sup><span class="citationtooltip"><a class = "citationnumbers" href="#11">[11]</a><a class = "citationlinks" target = "_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987719307145">"Personality changes following heart transplantation: The role of cellular memory", Medical Hypotheses</a></span></span> 
                    Indeed, human consciousness reverberates from the heart as much as it does from the brain.</p>
                <p id="signoffline">When your mind is invaded and its consciousness compromised, the only thing that can be relied upon to save you is the consciousness of the heart. When the mind is further impacted by forced medication and non-consensually administered electric shocks, you must rely on your heart's consciousness to recover. This is the basis for this blog.</p>
